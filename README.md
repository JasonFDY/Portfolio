# Jason Yeung - Portfolio

## About
Hi, my name is Jason. I'm an aspiring data analyst and a GPhC registered pharmacist with a Masters in Pharmacy from Keele University. I am self taught and have developed skills in Excel/Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, R and Python by completing courses on Codecademy and the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

### Why I Am Changing Careers
Admittedly, this is quite a drastic change, but I believe it is the right career move for myself. To make a long story short, pharmacy was never a career I dreamt about, it was more of a matter of being guided in that direction because of the subjects I performed well in and it being a well regarded profession. I have learnt a lot and have developed a lot of skills as a pharmacist and a manager, however, I have since come to the realisation that unfortunately, it is not a career I can see myself in in the long term. 

I would like my job to be something I have more of a personal interest in, I would like to really geek out about what I do and I have found that in data analytics. Since I started my learning, I have been able to really appreciate how data can be used and the insights that it brings. The fact that there is so much to learn is really exciting and it is so satisfying being able to solve problems using this knowledge. 

As you can probably tell, I'm really looking forward to the opportunities which lie ahead for me. I have made this repository to showcase my journey, the courses I have completed and the projects I have worked on.

## Projects
### [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/JasonFDY/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Grouping%20Grocery%20Store%20Customers.ipynb)
__Description__: Clustering of customers from sales data taken from Kaggle. I performed recency, frequency, monetary analysis of customer sales data, transformed data to remove skewness and created a K-means clustering model to identify groups of customers.\
__Results__: Four different groups of customers were identified; new customers, customers in danger of being lost, customers who have been lost and loyal customers. Ideally, the monetary section of the analysis would have used monetary values, however, as that wasn't available, the number of items bought was used to calculate this.\
__Tech Stack__: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

### [A/B Testing for Fast Food Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/JasonFDY/AB-Test-Promotions/blob/main/AB%20Testing%20-%20Fast%20Food%20Marketing%20Campaign.ipynb)
__Description__: A/B testing using data from Kaggle to decide between three possible marketing campaigns for a fast food chain promoting a new product. I performed exploratory data analysis through visualisations, transformed data to remove skewness and performed ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests to determine which of three possible marketing campaigns should be chosen.\
__Results__: The ANOVA test determined that null hypothesis of the marketing campaigns, not being statistically different, was rejected and the results of the Tukey test determined that marketing campaign 3 was the best.\
__Tech Stack__: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook

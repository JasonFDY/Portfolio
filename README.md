## About
Hi, my name is Jason. I'm a GPhC registered pharmacist with a Masters in Pharmacy from Keele University. I have spent two sucessful years as a Pharmacy Manager but I am now transitioning to a career in data. Admittedly, this is quite a drastic change but I am excited for the opportunities which lie ahead.

I have created this respository to showcase my journey, the courses I have completed and the projects I have worked on.
